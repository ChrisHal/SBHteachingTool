todo list:
for Version 1.1:
change slider from [CO2] to pCO2, since this is probably easier for the students.
(Will need changing of some texts / translations) - done

for Version 2.0:
add menu mnemonics (for every supported lcoale)  - done
add File -> quit menu entry with shortcut (CTRL+Q) 	done

simplify mathematics: use approximation (using mainly the fact that SBE is approx. same as BE)
This should be more performant than using the non-linear solver since we will end up with a 2nd order
polynomial that can be easily analytically solved.
